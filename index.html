    passion, by learning Bharatanatyam and western dance styles.</p>

    as a dance director was Vetri Vizha. He has since choreographed in over 100 movies.</p>
  <p>Before starting as a full-time actor, he did song sequences in films. His first movie as a hero was in Kadhalan with actress Nagma. Prabhu Deva's success resulted largely from his dancing. He has a significant fan following in the Tamil, Telugu

  <h2>Styles of Dance</h2>
  <p>This page will explain a few of the different ways that people dance.</p>
  <b>
    <h2>Ballet</h2>
  </b>

  <p>Ballet dance developed during the Italian Renaissance, before evolving in France and Russia into a concert dance meant for public performance. This is in the form of a ballet, in which the dance is choreographed with classical music.</p>
  <p>Despite the name, modern dance is just a name for dance that embraces free movement, as opposed to the strictly defined kind of movement common in ballet.</p>
  <p>Ballet productions vary between using elaborate costumes and staging and using minimal costuming and bare staging.</p>
  <p>Ballet is now a widespread, highly technical form of dance with many subgenres including classic, romantic, neoclassical and contemporary.</p>
  <p>With six core recognised methods: the Cecchetti method, the Bournoville method, the Vaganova method, the French School, the Royal Academy of Dance method and the Balanchine method, ballet is studied professionally at top dance schools all over
    the world.</p>
  <p>Harlequin Floors have developed a range of specialist ballet dance floors providing enough traction to prevent injury while still allowing for fluid movements demanded by ballet dancing. Harlequin Cascade is one of our most popular ballet
    dance floors and can be laid over many of our sprung floors.Harlequin Floors also offer professional ballet barres available as either permanent wall mounted, floor mounted or freestanding barres.</p>

  <h2><b>Ballroom</h2></b>
  <p>Ballroom dance is a type of partner dance originating at the end of the sixteenth century in France. Commonly used as shorthand for any partner dance, ballroom has today evolved into two main subgenres – standard/smooth and Latin/rhythm.</p>
  <p>Dances within these categories include the waltz, tango and foxtrot, and pasodoble, bolero and samba.</p>
  <p>Ballroom is a popular form of competitive dance, or dancesport, with competitions being held all over the world.</p>
  <p>With several sub-categories to ballroom dancing, dancers require a versatile floor. Harlequin Fiesta and our specially crafted
    Harlequin Liberty Ballroom is the used by the BBC’s ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ and Professional World Ballroom Dance Champion, Christopher Hawkins.</p>

  <h2><b>Contemporary</b></h2>
  <p>Developed during the mid-twentieth century, contemporary dance is now one of the most popular and technical forms of dance studied and performed professionally, especially in the US and Europe.

    Drawing on classical, modern and jazz dance styles, contemporary dance has evolved to incorporate many characteristics of a broader range of dance forms.

    Known for its emphasis on strong torso and legwork, contract and release, fall and recovery and floor work, it is often known for unpredictable and disordered changes in speed and rhythm throughout a performance.

    Contemporary dancers therefore require a shock-absorbing surface to protect their feet, legs and ankles from rapid movements and changes in rhythm. Harlequin’s innovative ‘triple sandwich’ Harlequin Activity sprung floor can be paired with
    several of our vinyl dance floors, to create the ideal surface for contemporary dance.</p>

  <h2><b>Hip-Hop</b></h2>
  <p>Hip-hop dancing refers to a range of street dances that developed in relation to hip hop music and culture. Hip-hop dancing dates back to the early 1970s in New York and California, evolving out of Funk and the development of break beat.

    Main styles of hip-hop dancing include Breaking, Locking and Popping, with derivative styles emerging out of these including Memphis Jookin’, Turfing, Jerkin’ and Krumping. These were often popularised and made mainstream after being featured in
    music videos of the time.

    Today, hip-hop is performed in outdoor spaces, in dance studios and competitively.

    Unlike many competitive dance styles, hip-hop is often improvisational with dance crews challenging each other to dance battles.

    At Harlequin Floors we have created Harlequin Freestyle, a specialist dance floor designed specifically to meet the unique demands of Hip Hop and other street dance styles.</p>

<h2> Bharatnatyam, Tamil Nadu/South India</h2></b>
<p>Bharatanatyam, also known as the mother of all other classical dance styles, is considered as the oldest dance forms in the country India that originated from the temple dancers in Tamil Nadu. The dance is a pure amalgam of expressions, music,
  beat and rhythm.</p>

  <h2>Kathak, Uttar Pradesh/North India</h2>
</b>
<p>Another popular and recognised form of classical Indian dance is Kathak that originated from Uttar Pradesh in north India. This one is derived from the word katha meaning story, and during the whole dance, the dancers narrate stories through their
  eyes and expressions.</p>

  <h2>Kathakali, Kerala/South India</h2>
</b>
<p>This one is probably one of the most attractive, dramatic and elaborate forms of classical Indian dance. Kathakali originated in the south Indian state of Kerala, also known as God's Own Country during the 17th century. The artist performing the
  dance needs to have detailed make-up, wear heavy costumes and, most importantly, work on their gestures.</p>

<b>
  <h2>Kuchipudi, Andhra Pradesh/South India</h2>
</b>
<p>Kuchipudi is considered one of the toughest forms of Indian classical dance that originated in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The form is considered the toughest because it requires a whole lot of rituals, from lighting the incense
  sticks to sprinkling holy water and praying to the lord.</p>

<b>
  <h2>Manipuri, Manipur/Northeast India</h2>
</b>
<p>Manipuri dance form originated in the northeastern state of Manipur and is a pure spiritual experience. This is a theme based classical dance form that depicts Raaslila or the romantic act of the Hindu gods Radha and Krishna. Costumes and makeup
  plays an important role here.</p>
